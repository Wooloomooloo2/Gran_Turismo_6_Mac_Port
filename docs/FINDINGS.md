## Game and updates (2026-10-27)

- Disc: BCES01977 v1.00 (UK), `Gran Turismo 6 (UK).iso`, 25.3 GB, already disc-decrypted.
  `PARAM.SFO`: TITLE_ID BCES01977, APP_VER 01.00, VERSION 01.03, PS3_SYSTEM_VER 04.50.
  `USRDIR`: `EBOOT.BIN` (72 KB), `EMAIN.SELF` (8.8 MB), `GT.VOL` (15.4 GB).
  `PS3_UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP`: firmware 4.50.
- Updates: Sony's list `BCES01977-ver.xml` has 21 packages, 1.02 to 1.22, 11.2 GB. All
  downloaded to `~/Gran Turismo 6/updates` and verified.
- Hash rule: Sony's SHA-1 in `BCES01977-ver.xml` covers the package minus its last 32 bytes.
  The package's last 32 bytes are that SHA-1 plus 12 zero bytes.
- Sony root certificates were obtained by running RPCS3 with `--installfw` on the disc's PUP,
  then bundled to PEM for `curl --cacert`. TLS checking was never turned off.
- Not yet verified: per-file hashes of the disc (redump checksums do not apply to a decrypted
  image; the community IRD lists per-file hashes).
